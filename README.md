# SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Practices

## `Google Search Console`

Google Search Console is a web service by Google which allows webmasters to check indexing status, search queries, crawling errors and optimize visibility of their websites.

* Log into account -> Enter domain name of website -> Copy TXT record into the DNS configuration for https://ryanabeysinghe.com/ in Hostinger

* Once sitemap.xml is created go to -> Sitemaps tab -> Add a new sitemap URL and it should be good to go 

## `Robots.txt`

A robots.txt file tells search engines what your website's rules of engagement are. A big part of doing SEO is about sending the right signals to search engines, and the robots.txt is one of the ways to communicate your crawling preferences to search engines.
